Buildbot 8.x Plastic SCM Poller

This is a dead-simple method to hook up Plastic SCM to a buildbot 8 master server to handle push events.

I was hoping to get some time to clean this up before release, however here is the non-generic last used python "module" from a working buildbot 8 master.  There is no way for me to test changes past the initial commit.
